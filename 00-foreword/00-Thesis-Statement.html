                        <h1 id="thesis-statement">Thesis Statement</h1>
<p>Since the United Nations publication of Our Common Future (Brundtland, 1987), sustainable development has become a prominent concept in creating a more economical, social and environmentally friendly world. It was also in the 19th Century that the zoned planning system was developed, which meant areas were developed with single uses. While the aim was to improve quality of life, this approach was successful in that it prevented social injustices such as industry being adjacent to housing, but it has had other costly consequences on city developments. The largest of which is the nature of urban sprawl, which depends on automobiles to obtain most services. This sort of city development was shaped by an era run by cheap oil. A system which seemed to run efficiently back then, is now problematic due to the growth of population and private vehicle ownership over the past few decades. Modern cities suffer an endless list of problems because of urban sprawl, including loss of productive land, traffic congestion and spiralling infrastructure cost among others (Duany, Plater-Zyberk, &amp; Speck, 2000)</p>
<h2 id="evolution-of-christchurch">Evolution of Christchurch</h2>
<p>Christchurch, like most cities, has been progressively shaped by the evolution of transport technologies from walking to transit and automobile. This enabled cities to form a new style of development, which resulted in a push outwards. This is coined by Newman as the “one hour wide city”, which meant that cities could easily spread up to fifty kilometres as long as the commute time stays within one hour (Newman &amp; Jennings, 2008). This is a natural evolution of cities and is “understandable but not wholly beneficial”(Coupland, 1996). This change of city size via change in transport technology is noteworthy in that, each advancement allowed an
expansion of the city, it also made the previous transport technology less effective (Dravitzki &amp; Lester, 2007). For instance, The existing transport network in Christchurch favours people to drive cars. It is perceived as the easiest, most convenient way to travel. Thus the growth of the private vehicle has reached 0.8 vehicles per capita in 2008 (Ministry of Transport, 2012) while consequently the patronage on public transport is at a historic low.</p>
<h2 id="public-transport-in-christchurch">Public Transport in Christchurch</h2>
<p>Christchurch’s current urban sprawl condition has made its bus network inefficien and has consequently resulted in low patronage over the years. However in the wake of the recent earthquakes, now is the perfect time to rethink the transport network, at the same time future proof the impeding shortage of petroleum. The cordoned off city centre further accentuates the demand of a new transport solution as roadways suffer from congestions, adding to drivers’ frustrations. What was a mono-centric city is now gradually transforming into a multi-nodal city as business begins to shift outside of the city centre. The recent draft plan proposed by the Christchurch City Council (CCC) in December 2011 addressed the need for an alternative transport by reintroducing light-rail, however there was a constant lack of evidence provided by the CCC to persuade the government to help fund the $1.8 billion package, especially knowing that mass rapid transit will only be effective when provided with sufficient population density, (Jhumm, 2012). Christchurch lacks the critical ingredient for making a successful transit solution: Density. Therefore the large investment funds into state highways and road widening from the government has long been the short-term fix to resolve road congestion. This thesis discusses the notion that Christchurch is becoming a “City
of Fear” instead of “City of Hope”. (Newman, Beatley, &amp; Boyer, 2009)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cities of fear make decisions based on short- term, even panicked, responses; cities of hope plan for the long term, with each decision building towards that vision, hopeful that some of the steps will be tipping points that lead to fundamental change. Cities of fear engage in competition as their only driving force, while cities of hope build consensus around cooperation and partnership. Cities of fear see threats everywhere while cities of hope see opportunities to improve in every crisis.&quot;</p>
<p>(Newman et al., 2009)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Public transportation services are pivotal to the wellbeing of a nation. They provide mobility, shape land use and development patterns, generate jobs and enable economic growth, and support public policies regarding energy use, air quality and carbon emissions (Weisbrod &amp; Reno, 2009). This thesis aims to dissect the current conditions of Christchurch’s transportation network and its effects on the economy.</p>
<p>It is recognised that as oil becomes increasingly scarce, transport and commodity prices will increase (Mitchell, 2008). The availability of cheap oil has a major contribution to Christchurch’s low density living as people are prepared to travel farther to engage in activities. The low travel costs have occurred simultaneously with societal changes such as increased household income, smaller families, more leisure time and the shift from shopping as necessity to shopping as recreation (Rotem-Mindali &amp; Salomon, 2007). It is for the aforementioned social changes and shift to private transport that significantly changed New Zealand retail landscapes such as the domination by malls, big box retail centres and supermarkets (Abigail, 2009). Retailers have taken advantage of commuting behaviours in land on the edges of cities where rents are cheaper. However as driving costs increase in the near future, this thesis believes that there will be a corresponding shift of ammenities to focus back to central places.</p>
<h2 id="pushing-past-the-4th-wave">Pushing Past the 4th Wave</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, transportation technology has been the main driver that shapes the urban form. It was the five waves of innovation (Water power mechanisation, steam power rail, electricity, petroleum and digital networks) that contributed to societal changes for the last two centuries (Newman et al., 2009). While we are already entering the sixth wave of innovation, namely sustainable development, Christchurch’s urban form still lingers at the 4th wave, the automobile city. As innovation of digital networks created new ways of communicating over recent years, this thesis raises the question of how innovation of information technology could potentially change commuting behaviours to affect the future urban fabric of Christchurch.</p>
<h2 id="multi-modal-city">Multi-modal City</h2>
<p>Within the New Zealand context Christchurch has the highest vehicle ownership, with 0.8 cars per capita and 2.5 cars per household. Its car use pattern suggests that 95% of commute to work are occupied by only a single occupant, the driver (Ministry of Transport, 2012). The problem is not the number of cars we own, but how we travel that makes a significant difference to the community; the preference is not by choice, but forced due to the lack of choice. This thesis aims to propose innovative solutions that promotes car-sharing, while at the same time designing a more efficient transport system. The intention is to push Christchurch past its auto-dependent state, into a multi-modal city.</p>
<h2 id="carpark-reclamation">Carpark Reclamation</h2>
<p>It is evident that the amount of abundant amount of spaces dedicated to car parking within the city center has had adverse effects on public transport patronage; minimum parking requirements has been the one planning rule that does more damage to public transport than any other. It has provided a substantial hidden subsidy for those who drive, compared to those who commute via public transport, or walk or cycle (Arbury, 2009). Cars can take up a substantial amount of space. A safe estimate suggests that 32% of the Cathedral Square area unit is covered with car parking spaces that could accommodate a minimum of 1,000 single detached homes or retail spaces. This thesis will address the adverse effects of the abundant amount of these single use spaces, and aims to find a solution to allow the reclamation of these wasted spaces. As the betterment of public transport progresses, such spaces can be utilized much more usefully to correspond the shift of ammenities to cenral places and the prevention of the aforementioned sprawl.</p>
<h2 id="adaptable-interchange">Adaptable Interchange</h2>
<p>Innovative startups such as Better Place, Zip Car and NextBike, suggests a new trend of personal transport solution that demands spontaneous solutions. Thus this thesis aims to devise an architecture response that can be highly adaptable to accommodate the fast-changing transportation technology landscape that has emerged over the recent years. This thesis proposes to design a new type of transit oriented architecture that not only caters to various modes of transport, but are flexible enough to be implemented within the whole of Christchurch.</p>
